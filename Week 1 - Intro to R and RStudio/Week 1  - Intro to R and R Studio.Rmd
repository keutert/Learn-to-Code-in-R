## Motivating example

## Why are we here?
- What do you want to learn?
- What do you think you'll learn?
- How do you think this will help you with your job?

## Goals for this course
- Solve a real business problem that you are facing
    - Improve a process, automate work, build a complex visualization
- Become comfortable using R/RStudio and know where to get help if you need it

## Why do we build with code?
- Flexibility/Power | if you can dream it, you can do it
- Readability | well-written and structured code can be understood at a glance
- Efficiency | limited computational overhead going to a user interface
- Version Control | easy to track changes and return to previous versions with a tool like GitHub


## What is R?
- R is a programming language like SQL or C++ or Python
- R was built specifically for doing statistical analysis
- R is Open Source
- Created in 2000
- Very strong/supportive community of developers
- Large library of packages for accomplishing anything you can think of 

## What is RStudio?
- RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- Other IDEs include Visual Studio, XCode or Toad
- RStudio allows you to interact with your computing environment, console, script, created visualizations, and many other tools directly in a single interface
- Without an IDE, you would be writing code in Notepad and using command prompt to execute it
- IDEs also have many quality of life features like syntax/error checking, code highlighting, code formatting and many others
