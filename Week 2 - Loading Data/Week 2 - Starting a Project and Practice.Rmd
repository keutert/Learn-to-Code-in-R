<!-- ## Kickoff Activity -->
<!-- - Open the file `bigData.csv` with the tool of your choice -->
<!--     - What tool did you use? -->
<!--     - How long does it take to open? -->
<!--     - How many rows does it have? -->

<!-- - Run `install.packages('tidyverse')` in R -->

## Starting a Project
- An R project simply a folder where all scripts, data, and other content related to your project will exist
- Using the command `getwd()` aka "get working directory" will tell you which folder or project you are in
- Think of projects like rooms in a house and all your project content is stuff in that room
    - If you ask for your water bottle and there is one in the room you are in, that is likely the water bottle you are talking about even if there is a water bottle in a different room
- You can also reference other folders inside of your room, i.e. (In my house, in the living room, in the bottom right desk drawer there is a piece of paper I need)
    - `home/livingRoom/desk/bottomRightDrawer/paper.txt`
    
## Starting a Project
- We are going to start a new project for this class
- File -> New Project
- New/Existing Directory
- Name
- Location
- Create a new script called `readingInData.R`

    
## Reading in Data
- Move the `bigData.csv` file into your working directory
- Read `bigData.csv` into R
    - Look at the head and tail of your data
    - How many rows does it have?
    - What is the largest value in your data?
    - What is the smallest value in your data?
    - What is the mean of your data?
    - What is the median of your data?
    
    
## Writing Data
- Add 10 to every value in `'bigData.csv'`
- Write this new data to a file called `'bigDataNew.csv'`

## Application
- Go find some data that you have been using recently or use frequently
- Read it into R
- Make a change to it
- Write it out with a new name
